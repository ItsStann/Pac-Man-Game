# Pac-Man-Game

A recreation of the famous arcade game **Pac-Man**, built in **Java** using **Swing** for graphics (GUI) and input/event handling.

- Implemented a interactive Pac-Man game using Java Swing for rendering and event handling to build the iconic arcade game
- Designed the chase and scatter movements/behaviors of the ghosts and built collision detection to simulate Pac-Man getting eaten or being eaten, eating of the pellets, and power pellets within the map walls
- Added additional features with lives tracking represented with Pac-Man images, score display at the top left alongside the high-score obtained by the player, and smooth controls and visuals for the game
- Showcases skills with object-oriented programming, event-driven design, and 2D game logic and programming

- Playable Pac-Man with **arrow-keys** controls
- **Ghost** "AI" that has the chasing mode and scared mode behaviors depending on conditions within the game
- **Collision detection** for walls, ghosts, pellets and the power pellets
- **Scoring system** and **lives tracker**
- Built with object oriented design/programming

## üõ†Ô∏è Programming/Languages used
- **Java**
- **Swing / AWT** # For rendering and input of the game
- **OOP**

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Compile and run the Pac-Man.java file utilizing the App.java

## How to play the Game
- Use the arrow keys to move the Pac-Man through the map
- The empty spaces to the left and right of the map can be utilized to teleport to the other side of the map
- Eat all the pellets on the map to move onto the next level and to continue progressing through the game
- Avoid ghosts when they are in their normal form (Red, Blue, Pink, Orange)
- Eat the power pellets (looks like pellets but are slightly bigger in size, 4 around the map) to turn ghosts "scared" making them eatable by Pac-Man to gain more points for a period of time before reverting back to their normal form
- After 3 deaths, the game ends and you can restart by clicking any key
